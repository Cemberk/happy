🎉 <strong>Now 100% peer-to-peer! No cloud dependencies!</strong> 🎉
</div>

## How does it work?

Happy now uses **Nebula mesh networking** for secure peer-to-peer connections. Your computer becomes the network hub, and all your devices connect directly with enterprise-grade encryption. No servers, no tracking, no third-party access to your code.

**Your Phone ←→ Encrypted Mesh ←→ Your Computer**

Run `happy` instead of `claude` and scan the QR code with your phone. Your devices are now connected!

## 🔒 Why Peer-to-Peer?

| **Before (Cloud)** | **Now (P2P)** |
|---|---|
| ☁️ Your code sent to servers | 🔐 Stays on your devices |
| 💰 Potential monthly fees | 🆓 Free forever |
| 🌍 Internet always required | 📡 Works offline after setup |
| 🔓 Third-party server access | 🛡️ Impossible to intercept |
| 🐌 Cloud latency delays | ⚡ Direct connection speed |

### 🔒 Security Features
- **Certificate-based authentication** using X25519 cryptography  
- **Double encryption**: Nebula network layer + Happy application layer
- **Zero-trust networking** - only authorized devices can connect
- **Forward secrecy** with ephemeral key exchange
- **Local-only operation** - works completely offline after initial setup

⚠️ **Security Notice**: This system generates cryptographic certificates stored in `~/.happy-nebula/`. Keep these secure.

**Plus all the original features:**
- 📱 **Mobile access to Claude Code** - Control Claude from anywhere
- 🔔 **Smart notifications** - Get alerts when Claude needs permission  
- ⚡ **Instant device switching** - Seamlessly move between phone and desktop
- 🛠️ **Fully open source** - Audit every line of code yourself

## 📦 Project Components

- **[happy-cli](https://github.com/Cemberk/happy-cli)** - Command-line interface for Claude Code
- **[happy-server](https://github.com/Cemberk/happy-server)** - Backend server for encrypted sync
- **happy-coder** - This mobile client (you are here)

## ⚠️ Security Checklist

Before running setup scripts, please review:

- ✅ **Script contents** - Read `setup-complete-system.sh` before executing
- ✅ **Certificate storage** - Understand that keys are stored in `~/.happy-nebula/`
- ✅ **Network configuration** - Review Nebula configuration for your network
- ✅ **Firewall rules** - Ensure UDP port 4242 is properly configured
- ✅ **Access controls** - Only share QR codes with devices you trust

**This system is designed for privacy**, but security depends on proper setup and usage.

## 🏠 Who We Are

We're engineers scattered across Bay Area coffee shops and hacker houses, constantly checking how Claude is progressing on our pet projects during lunch breaks. Happy Coder was born from the frustration of not being able to peek at Claude building our side hustles while we're away from our keyboards. We believe the best tools come from scratching your own itch and sharing with the community.
