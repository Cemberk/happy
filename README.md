## How does it work?

Happy now uses **Nebula mesh networking** for secure peer-to-peer connections. Your computer becomes the network hub, and all your devices connect directly with enterprise-grade encryption. No servers, no tracking, no third-party access to your code.

**Your Phone ←→ Encrypted Mesh ←→ Your Computer**

Run `happy` instead of `claude` and scan the QR code with your phone. Your devices are now connected!

## ?

## 🏠 Who We Are

We're engineers scattered across Bay Area coffee shops and hacker houses, constantly checking how Claude is progressing on our pet projects during lunch breaks. Happy Coder was born from the frustration of not being able to peek at Claude building our side hustles while we're away from our keyboards. We believe the best tools come from scratching your own itch and sharing with the community.
